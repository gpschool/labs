    "The non-parametric formulation that characterises Gaussian processes makes the cost of inference prohibitive when the number of data observations is large. The computational cost of inference is $\\mathscr{O}(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of observations, for full GP regression, as a result of matrix inversions required to calculate the posterior. In order to deal with this, an augmentation of the GP regression model called _sparse GPs_ aims to use a small set of _inducing variables_ to approximate the probability space. The driving idea is to find a posterior over the smaller set of $M (\\ll N)$ inducing variables instead of over $N$ training points to reduce the computational requirements. The challenge, then, is to find the set of inducing variables and model parameters that best approximate the full GP.\n",

    "In this example, we are going to use a variational sparse GP framework, where we approximate the likelihood with a _variational distribution_. For problems with a large number data, even sparse approximations can still have trouble scaling. A recent extension, particularly for classification of large data sets with GPs is using _stochastic variational inference_ for sparse GPs$^1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a large number of data, $N$, stochastic inference utilises some randomly selected _mini-batch_ of size $B$, over which we approximate the variational evidence lower bound as a noisy subsample, with the mini-batch sizes reducing much of the computational cost.\n",

    "We will use our sparse GP framework with the `core.SVGP` object in `GPy`. For now, we will just use an anisotropic `RBF` kernel with some fixed white noise, again $\\sigma^2=10^{-6}$. We use a Bernoulli likelihood with a probit link function, as in our previous examples, though we alternatively could try a sigmoid, or other link functions for this problem.\n",

    "Because we are using a sparse approximation, we are already making approximating the likelihood using a variational model. As a result, we don't need to specify our inference model, such as Laplace approximation. We will also use the density information to guide our inducing variable locations: we fit $k$-means and take the centroids as _fixed_ locations to save the optimiser some work. For now, we will use $M=8$ inducing variables.\n",
